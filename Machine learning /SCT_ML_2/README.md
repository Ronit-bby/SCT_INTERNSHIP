# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation with K-Means  

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Skill Craft Development**.  
The goal is to group retail store customers into segments based on their **purchase history**.  

## 🔑 Features  
- Uses **K-Means Clustering** (unsupervised learning).  
- Groups customers by **Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score**.  
- Visualizes clusters with **scatter plots** for better understanding.  
- Helps identify patterns like:  
  - 💎 High Spenders  
  - 📉 Low Spenders  
  - 🎯 Moderate Shoppers  

## 📊 Tech Stack  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🚀 Learnings  
- How clustering works in unsupervised ML  
- Using the **Elbow Method** to find the best number of clusters  
- Importance of data visualization in explaining clusters  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset is taken from Kaggle’s **Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python**.

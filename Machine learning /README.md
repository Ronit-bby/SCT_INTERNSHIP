# Machine Learning Scripts - SCT Internship

This directory contains two machine learning scripts that demonstrate different ML techniques:

## Scripts Overview

### 1. SCT_ML_1.py - California Housing Price Prediction
**Advanced House Price Prediction System using California Housing Dataset**

- **Dataset**: California Housing Dataset (20,640 real housing districts)
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression with feature engineering
- **Features**: 13 engineered features including income, location, property characteristics
- **Output**: House price predictions with interpretable coefficients

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive data exploration and visualization
- Smart feature engineering (distance to SF, coastal proximity, etc.)
- Realistic test scenarios for different California regions
- Performance metrics and coefficient analysis

### 2. SCT_ML_2.py - Customer Segmentation using K-Means
**Customer Segmentation Analysis with 3D Visualization**

- **Dataset**: Mall Customers Dataset (200 customers)
- **Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering
- **Features**: Age, Annual Income, Spending Score
- **Output**: Customer segments with 2D and 3D visualizations

**Key Features:**
- Elbow method for optimal cluster selection
- 2D and 3D scatter plots
- Cluster profile analysis
- Interactive visualizations

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install individually:
   ```bash
   pip3 install --break-system-packages pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Running the Scripts

### California Housing Price Prediction
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 SCT_ML_1.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Dataset loading and exploration
- Market analysis and visualizations
- Linear regression model training
- Feature importance analysis
- Realistic price predictions for different California regions

### Customer Segmentation
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 SCT_ML_2.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Elbow method plot for optimal clusters
- 2D scatter plot of customer segments
- 3D visualization of segments
- Cluster profile statistics

## Files Description

- `SCT_ML_1.py` - California housing price prediction script
- `SCT_ML_2.py` - Customer segmentation script
- `Mall_Customers.csv` - Customer dataset for segmentation
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Issues Solved

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Installed all required Python packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
2. **Missing Dataset**: Created `Mall_Customers.csv` with 200 customer records
3. **Data Type Error**: Fixed the groupby operation to only calculate means for numeric columns
4. **Virtual Environment**: Properly configured and activated the virtual environment

## Results Summary

### California Housing Model Performance:
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.6519 (65.2% variance explained)
- **Average Prediction Error**: $67,536
- **Key Drivers**: Income levels, geographic location, property characteristics

### Customer Segmentation Results:
- **Optimal Clusters**: 5 customer segments
- **Segments Identified**: Different customer profiles based on age, income, and spending patterns

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **ModuleNotFoundError**: Make sure the virtual environment is activated and packages are installed
2. **FileNotFoundError**: Ensure `Mall_Customers.csv` is in the same directory as the script
3. **Display Issues**: The scripts generate matplotlib plots - ensure you have a display environment

## Future Enhancements

- Add more advanced algorithms (Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Implement cross-validation
- Add model persistence and API endpoints
- Create interactive dashboards

# 🏡 Advanced House Price Prediction  

> 🚀 My **first internship ML project** — predicting California house prices using **20,640 real housing records**!  

---

## ✨ What’s Inside?  
✅ Data Exploration & Visualizations  
✅ Smart Feature Engineering (ratios, coastal proximity, etc.)  
✅ Linear Regression Model  
✅ Evaluation with R², MAE, RMSE  

---

## 📊 Cool Insights  
💰 **Income** strongly influences house prices  
🌊 Houses near the **coast** are way more expensive  
⏳ **House age** shows an interesting non-linear trend  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
🐍 Python  
📊 Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Seaborn  
🤖 Scikit-learn

## 🚧 Next Steps  
🔹 Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
🔹 Tune hyperparameters  
🔹 Deploy with Streamlit/Flask  

---

## 🙌 My Takeaway  
This project taught me the **core workflow of ML**:  
📥 Get data → 🔍 Explore → ⚙️ Engineer → 🤖 Train → 📉 Evaluate → 🎨 Visualize  

---

🔥 First step into my Machine Learning journey — more creative projects coming soon!
